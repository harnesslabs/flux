## 2026-03-29: TimeStepStrategy concept uses structural signature checking

**Decision:** `TimeStepStrategy(S)` validates `S.step` via `@typeInfo` — checking parameter
count, parameter types, and that the return is an error union with `void` payload — rather
than comparing `@TypeOf(S.step) == fn(Allocator, *State, f64) anyerror!void`.

**Alternatives considered:**
1. Exact type equality (`@TypeOf(S.step) == expected`): rejected because Zig distinguishes
   inferred error sets from `anyerror`. A function declared `fn(...) !void` gets a concrete
   error set, not `anyerror`, so no real implementation would match the exact type.
2. Duck typing (no concept check, just `anytype`): rejected because silent failures at
   call sites are harder to debug than a concept-level compile error.

**Rationale:** Structural checking accepts any error set in the return type, which is the
correct generality — an integrator's error set depends on which operators it calls. The
concept guarantees the parameter contract (allocator, state pointer, dt) while staying
permissive on the error set.

## 2026-03-29: Two-layer TimeStepper design — concept + generic wrapper

**Decision:** Split into `TimeStepStrategy` (comptime concept) and `TimeStepper(Strategy)`
(generic wrapper). Users define a strategy struct with the raw physics/numerics, then
pass it to `TimeStepper(...)` which validates the contract and provides a uniform
integrator with step counting.

**Alternatives considered:**
1. Single `TimeStepper` concept with no wrapper: simpler, but forces every consumer
   (runners, composition) to re-implement step counting and any shared integrator logic.
2. Inheritance-style base struct: not idiomatic Zig. Comptime generics with concept
   validation is the Zig equivalent of Rust's `impl Trait` pattern.

**Rationale:** The two-layer design separates concerns — strategy authors define physics,
the wrapper provides infrastructure (step counting now, diagnostics/observers later).
This matches the "pluggable time integrators" horizon and enables future composition
(Strang splitting wraps two `TimeStepper` instances).
